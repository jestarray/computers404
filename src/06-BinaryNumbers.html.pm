@h1{Binary Numbers}
Humans use a base 10 number system for counting numbers, most likely because have 10 fingers. For example, using your fingers to do @code{8 + 4}, since we don't have 11 fingers we close our hands and have to hold a 10 in our mind, reset our fingers and add two: + 2 = 12.

This number system is natural for us but imagine a dolphin counting with it's 2 fins. 1 + 2 = 3, but they don't have 3 fins so they have to hold in their mind increments of 2. Computers are just like this in that they use a base 2 system(aka binary) of couting in contrast to our base 10(decimal).

Recall(in the language chapter) that 4 bits gives us a maximum of 16 unique combinations because (@(2^ "4") = 16).

@(max-unsigned-limit-table 4)

Every 1 toggles corresponding powers of two: 
@(table (table-headings (two-subscripts 4)) (table-entries (list 0 0 0 0)))

If we need more to represent numbers over 16, we need to expand to 5 bits, @(2^ 5) = 32

@(table (table-headings (two-subscripts 5)) (table-entries (list 0 0 0 0 0)))

@h3{Subtraction method}
@steps{
    @step{
Find the biggest power of 2 that is less than the decimal number and place a 1 in that position

Let's try converting the number 13
@(deci->bin-table 8 4)
8 is the biggest power of 2 that is less than 13, hence we put a 1 there.}
    @step{
Subtract it from the original number and repeat step 1 until you subtract to 0
13-8 = 5
@(deci->bin-table 12 4)
Now we need to look for the next biggest power of 2 that is less than 5, which is 4, hence we put a 1 there.

@p{5 - 4 = 1}
Lastly 1 fits with 1, so 1 - 1 = 0, and we are done.
@(deci->bin-table 13 4) 8+4+0+1 = 13; thus 1101 represents 7}}

What is the decimal number 233 in binary?
@(deci->bin-table 233 8)
answer: 11101001; which you can confirm adds up to 233. Notice how we needed to expand to 8 bits to represent this number because 233 can only fit into 8 bits or higher: @(2^ "8") = 256

        Note: The remainder will always be 0 or 1
    }
    @step{
        Gather all the remainders from bottom to top
